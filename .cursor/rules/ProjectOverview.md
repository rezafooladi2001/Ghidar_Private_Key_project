The project name is Ghidar.

It consists of three main parts:

Backend (PHP + MySQL) – based on a fork of the Rocky clicker backend.

Blockchain Service (Node.js + TypeScript) – monitors USDT on ERC20/BEP20/TRC20 and calls the backend.

Telegram Mini App (React + TypeScript) – runs as a Telegram WebApp, talking to the backend via JSON APIs.

The core features:

Airdrop / Clicker using an internal token GHD.

Lottery – tickets bought with USDT, winners paid in internal USDT balance.

AI Trader – internal USDT balance with deposit/withdraw + performance dashboard.
