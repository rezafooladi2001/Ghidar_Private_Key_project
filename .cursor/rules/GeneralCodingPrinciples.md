Always write clean, readable, production-quality code.

Prefer explicit over implicit behavior.

Avoid “magic numbers” and hard-coded strings; extract to constants or config.

Never leave TODOs without a clear comment and intention.

Prefer small, focused functions instead of large “god functions”.

Avoid copy-paste; extract reusable logic to helpers/services.

When editing existing code:

Preserve the existing structure & conventions if they are reasonable.

Make minimal necessary changes, but if the current structure is clearly bad, propose and implement a better refactor with clear comments.
