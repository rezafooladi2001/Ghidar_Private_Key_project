Before making big refactors:

Explain the proposed change in comments or commit message.

When creating new files:

Provide full file content, not snippets.

When editing existing files:

Show the modified sections clearly.

Prefer consistent naming:

Ghidar for brand.

GHD for internal token.

usdt_balance, ghd_balance, ticket_count, ai_accounts, etc.
